# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?
how diffrent the independant variable is, or how spread out the data is

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?
123.47

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
the modle needs a lot more data to be accurate. it currently can make some vastly diffrent predictions then what it actually is and that could be especialy bad for testing bood pressure.
